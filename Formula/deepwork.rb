  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      DeepWork includes `uv` for managing Python environments.
      AI agents can create project-specific virtual environments:
        uv venv .venv
        uv pip install <package>
    EOS
  end

  test do
    system bin/"deepwork", "--version"
    system "uv", "--version"
  end
end
